Master Graduation Project. This code consists of 3 parts: 
(1) a esp32 connected to a wind direction & speed sensor, measuring the wind and sending the data via espNow to 
(2.1) an esp32 connected via serial to an (2.2) arduino mega, controlling an interactive wind display and sends the data (manipulated by interaction) to 
(3) a group of esp32 connected to lamps whos brightness & behavior is controlled through the data received
